My first repisotory on GitHub

Today is Tuesday 6th January, the day I first started on GitHub.
I'm really here to learn and expand my knowledge in programming.
Maybe along the way I'll be able to actually contribute once I get good, gain confidence and lock down the basics.
I don't really know what my first project will be yet but let's hope all goes well.
